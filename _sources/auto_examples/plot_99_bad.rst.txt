Importance of Controls and Parameter Selection

   implication on general linear models in functional near-infrared
   spectroscopy. Neurophotonics. 2016;3(1)

This tutorial demonstrates how **NOT** to process your fNIRS data.
Here I demonstrate that with a simple process pipelines even random noise
can look like a canonical haemodynamic response.

This tutorial was written to motivate further interest in to what affect
signal processing has on our data. And to provide a concrete example
about why you should understand your analysis and not vary parameters to meet
preconceived ideas of what your data should look like.
I recommend specifying analysis parameters in advance along with your experimental
protocol. Hopefully this tutorial also highlights the importance of
including a control condition in your experimental design.

The
:ref:`MNE fNIRS waveform tutorial <mne:tut-fnirs-processing>`
is used as a basis for this analysis, so most of the document looks similar.
However, at the midpoint we replace the real data with noise and demonstrate
that without careful attention to the analysis parameter it would still
appear as if a fNIRS response is observed.

Selecting channels appropriate for detecting neural responses
-------------------------------------------------------------

First we remove channels that are too close together (short channels) to
detect a neural response (less than 1 cm distance between optodes).
These short channels can be seen in the figure above.
To achieve this we pick all the channels that are not considered to be short.

Extract epochs
--------------

Now that the signal has been converted to relative haemoglobin concentration,
and the unwanted heart rate component has been removed, we can extract epochs
related to each of the experimental conditions.

First we extract the events of interest and visualise them to ensure they are
correct.

Summary
--------------

Above is a waveform that has many of the characteristics that are expected
from a haeomodynamic response.
We see a baseline that is around zero, the oxyhaemoglobin is positive
and the deoxyhaemoglobin is negative,
the peak occurs around 5 seconds then returns to
baseline.
However, it was generated from random noise!

As this is an introduction tutorial I do not go in to details about the
signal process theory behind why the settings above are wrong.
But if you are interested you should start with a DSP textbook
on signals and systems.

There are many signal processing parameter choices that interact to produce
your end result. It is important to have a control condition to ensure
that you aren't forcing your data to have these fake responses.
Its also important to understand the effect that each parameter choice
has on your output. Using a receiver operating characteristic is a good
approach to understand your analysis.
This also highlights some of the concerns with the time domain analysis
approach, and the benefits of the GLM style of analysis
:ref:`(see MNE-NIRS fNIRS GLM tutorial) <tut-fnirs-hrf>` (and Huppert 2016).
